### 🎯 OH Telemetry Collector loan test

OH telemetry collector loan test was developed for testing the applications workload. So that we can make a comparison between the POC in Java, Rust and TypeScript.

The applications are the following:

- [oh_telemetry_collector_server_rust](https://github.com/goto-eof/oh_telemetry_collector_server_rust) 
    - 💻 Technologies: Rust, Warp, Sea-ORM, Postgres
    - 🚎 Rust server responds on: `http://127.0.0.1:8017`
    - 🗄️ DB: `localhost:5437/postgres`
- [oh_telemetry_collector_server_java](https://github.com/goto-eof/oh_telemetry_collector_server_java) 
    - 💻 Technologies: Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, Postgres
    - 🚎 Java server responds on: `http://127.0.0.1:8013`
    - 🗄️ DB: `localhost:5433/postgres`    
- [oh_telemetry_collector_server_ts](https://github.com/goto-eof/oh_telemetry_collector_server_ts) 
    - 💻 Technologies: Typescript, Express, TypeORM, Postgres
    - 🚎 JS server responds on: `http://127.0.0.1:8019`
    - 🗄️ DB: `localhost:5439/postgres`    

Remember first to run all three docker containers: docker-compose up and remember to truncate table before test rerun.

The test result is under the reports directory. 

A meangfull value is the P95 percentile. It means that 95% of all our request had a response time equal or less than the value in the report. So that less is better.


#### 🎯 Install packages

```bash
npm install
```

#### 🎯 Run artillery for rust API and generate reports

```bash
npm run rust
```

#### 🎯 Run artillery for java API and generate reports

```bash
npm run java
```

#### 🎯 Run artillery for typescript API and generate reports

```bash
npm run js
```

#### 🎯 Run artillery (sequentially) for all of them and generate reports

```bash
npm run java && npm run rust && npm run js
```

or 

```bash
npm run all
```

or  for a loan test with a constant number of virtual users

```bash
npm run kall
```


### 🎯 Moreover

If you have a mac and the java loan test does not work, it could be that the Dockers VM has not enought space for the application container, so that change settings of VM.
